-- CURRENT PROGRESS --

- every node shares the same dataset now (load uci_cbm_dataset.txt in 15th line of ml.go) and uses it for training. There're some bugs inside. You can try to run joint_training.sh to see the update of weights in A.out, but the loss isn't converge.

-- NOTE --
- I found that every beginning letter should be captial case; otherwise it cannot be serialized by protobuf
